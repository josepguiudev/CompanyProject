# CompanyProject
In this project we are going to make a quick overview of how to connect applications with different languages to an api and from there communicate with a database.
## First steps to follow: 
### - We will use mysql as data manager where we will create a table for users
### - We will use .NET 8 to create the api in c#.
### - We will use a small program in c# to manage users
